# PantryRecipeApp
Pantry is a sleek, minimalistic Recipe Storer App that uses Material UI, 
Flutter, and Firebase.

Current Functionality of the App
--
Users can view their saved recipes from any device they are logged
into as well as add, edit, and delete this recipes. They can sign in,
register, sign out, and delete their account.


This app was started as a final project for ISTE 252 - Foundations of 
Mobile Design at Rochester Institute of Technology. 
--
For our final we were tasked with creating an app with flutter that
had a minimum of 3 pages and used data in some way. I went a little 
above and beyond, with a seven page app that uses Firebase database
and implimented their login.


Future Goals for the app
-- 
In the near future I would like to impliment a search feature and the
ability to store the recipes in folders for easy access. In the later
future, the ability to read a recipe from a pasted link would be 
awesome.
